1. Visibility of system status 
	Always keep users informed about what is going on.
	Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation – 2/3
The system status throughout the website is relatively visible. When I hover over certain clickable options, the text will become underlined (or if it’s a “read more” or “search” button, the button will change color). This feedback let’s me know instantly that I am selecting the correct item to click on and further navigate the site. While these attempts to show system status are appreciated, there is inconsistency of this across all the website. Certain menu items, such as clicking the logo on the homepage, selecting “Browse topics” on the homepage, or the top ribbon link to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, do not provide any sort of feedback that I am hovering over the option before I commit and click on whichever item.
2. Match between system and the real world 
	Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
	Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation – 2/3
The main menu options on the home page are familiar enough to everyday users, so people are able to specify which option to click on to satisfy their health concerns. Under each of the main menu items, sub menu items are also included to try and further find the particular information that a user might want. For instance, “Doctor Visits” is a main menu item, while “Regular Checkups” is a subtitle under this category. With that being said, the menu is not presented on the home page in a similar format to other health sites that I’ve visited. Typically, most main menu titles are listed in a horizontal line towards the top quarter of the screen, for users to immediately see once they are on the homepage. For MyHealthfinder’s website, this menu was only visible once a person clicked “Browse topics,” which pulled up titles and subtitles one would look to find. I can see how the current format simplifies the composition of homepage at first glance, yet the non-default approach is somewhat disorienting.
3. User control and freedom 
	Users often choose system functions by mistake.
	Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
	Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation 2/3
For the most part, the user feels that they have control and freedom over where to navigate, and how to move backwards should they click a wrong link. The predictability of each page’s format depending on whether it is a title page or subtitle page allows the user to recognize where they are and click the back arrow if they want to go back to the previous page. With that being said, I wish there was a direct “previous page” button somewhere once the user clicks on a specific arcticle under the subtitle pages. In the middle left, there is a moderately clear going-back option, but it is rather disorienting since it only shows the title of the previous page you were on in small text, with a small back arrow. As a user, going through the vast categories and subcategories of information present on this site, I feel that this option could be displayed more clearly to the user. Not only should it be in a more visible location, I feel that we should get a big picture indicator of where we are in terms of categories of the entire site, not just the title of the last page visited.
4. Consistency and standards 
	Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
	Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation 3/3
Overall, the consistency of categorization of information is fairly decent. Titles are given the same visual importance through text size, color, and font. Information under each healthcare category is presented in the same order, when clicked on, so that the output of information to the user becomes predictable. For each page, there will be a general overview title (distinguished in large blue font), a general overview paragraph below, and a series of links to possible questions pertaining to the topic of the page. The subtitle pages to click on are displayed clearly to the user, each encased in a box that has a photograph, with the subtitle text below. The same type of photograph will headline the preceding page should a user click on that subtitle link. This subtle way of following through ensures to the user that they are on the right track towards receiving the information that they were searching for.
5. Error prevention 
	Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation 2/3
Through underlining/highlighting keywords as one hovers over them, users are prevented from clicking on the wrong link. This sort of logic should apply to all items on the webpage however, which it currently doesn’t. A prime example of this would be the language icon in the top right of the homepage, where one clicks “Espanol,” or “English” without any indicator of the other languages they could potentially want to display. 
6. Recognition rather than recall 
	Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
	User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
	Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation 2/3
As mentioned previously, the photographs on the general title pages that distinguish each subtitle are a great way of engraining a certain image in the user’s mind for each type of information that they already visited. The similar format that characterizes the different types of pages (title pages vs. subtitle pages) helps the user familiarize where they are on the site. Nevertheless, I still think the user should be able to see what page they are on categorically relative to the rest of the site.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
	Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
	Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation 2/3
I noticed a few shortcut buttons to go to the preceding subtitle article, but this was inconsistent across all pages, and left me quite disoriented. I also wished there was a way to hover over the general main menu titles to display the subtitles, without making the full commitment of clicking on the title. Other than that, navigation was relatively seamless (you click on a title, it takes you to the next page). It wouldn’t make sense to shortcut any other actions further.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
	Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
	Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation -3/3
I would venture to say that the best part of this website is arguably its minimalist aesthetic and sensible visual choices in which to display the information. Not only are the general formats visually appealing and easy to digest to the user, they communicate only the information that the user needs, so that one doesn’t have to needlessly sift through paragraphs to try and locate whatever they are searching for. With that being said, I wish there was more information displayed on the homepage, specifically laying out all of the main menu options instead of hiding them under a “Browse topics” tab.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
	Expressed in plain language (no codes)
	Precisely indicate the problem
	Constructively suggest a solution. 

Evaluation – 1/3
When I searched “constipation” in the general searchbar on the homepage, I was instantly taken to an error page which clearly displayed “Sorry, no MyHealthfinder search results for that query.” This is a good start, but there should be more to communicate to the user why no search results came up. Even better, there should be a follow up question such as “Did you mean to search….?” or “No articles came up under the world ‘constipation.’” More needs to be done so that the user is able to recognize and learn from faulty searches on this website.
10. Help and documentation 
	Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
	Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. 

Evaluation – 1/3
Help and documentation is relatively nonexistent on this site. The closest thing I could find to something within this category was a vague link titled “accessibility” at the bottom of the homepage, which mainly listed off legal language that an average user would be clueless about. There was no way to problem-solve my faulty search for “constipation.” In the future, a live chat, or “help button” needs to be present.
