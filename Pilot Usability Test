Introduction:
MyHealthfinder is a website that provides information on various health-related topics related to health, including doctor visits, everyday living, and pregnancy. The user can search various health conditions, learn about medical testing/screening processes, and read articles detailing information about all of the main categories mentioned previously. The site is coordinated by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and aims for users to have general health-related questions answered in an efficient manner. 
 
After conducting a heuristic evaluation on MyHealthFinder, several concerns emerged regarding usability. Firstly, the website is inconsistent in the ways it displays system status; only a select amount of things provide feedback to the user. MyHealthFinder could also be more developed to match its system to the real world in terms of the familiarity of its home page format. Lastly, the site could greatly expand on helping users recognize and recover from errors in usability, as well as documentation of said errors. 

Given these issues, I will administer a usability test to fully grasp how much the potential design issues I have mentioned previously affects users in their ability to perform whatever tasks they wish to on the website. The test will strive to display the efficiency, clarity, and overall satisfaction of MyHealthfinder. 

Methodology:
Due to the concerns surrounding the pandemic, the moderator and participant will be in contact remotely, through a Zoom call. Prior to the Zoom meeting, the participant has been mailed a consent form and given informed consent in order to proceed without any breaches of privacy. Once entering the usability test, The participant has been mailed all of the links (in chronological order) to the survey questions, including a background questionnaire, pre and post-test questionnaire, and finally, a demographics questionnaire. Additionally, they have this overview document to help guide them along the process. I will walk them through step by step as they navigate each of the tasks I have decided will most accurately shed light on the usability concerns I was suspicious of.  The pilot usability test will be conducted with the participant and moderator in a quiet office setting, only communicating with each other throughout the test. The participant will communicate their thoughts to the moderator as they navigate each task, and complete the surveys. Upon answering the survey questions, they will communicate their thoughts to the moderator as they click through the surveys. Finally, they will fill out the demographics form, and the test will be over.
